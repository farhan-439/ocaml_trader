  Our project is a stock simulation system that allows users to simulate stock
  trading with a set budget. Users can buy and sell stocks, track portfolio 
  performance over time, and manage a real-time portfolio with live market 
  updates.

  This project demonstrates skills in OCaml programming, user interface 
  design, asynchronous programming with Lwt, and financial data handling to 
  create an educational tool for budding investors. It includes features for 
  both simulated and real-time stock trading, providing a comprehensive 
  learning experience.
